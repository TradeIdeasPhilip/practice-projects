# Practice Projects

These are a bunch of small projects that I did to practice HTML/JavaScript/CSS.

These are all pretty simple.
You don't need any tools to build anything.
You don't need to copy anything to a website.

All of these have a decent chance of running.
I tested most of them with Chrome and Windows.
No promises!

* Triangle Doodles — I used to doodle like this by hand.
  * [First version](https://tradeideasphilip.github.io/practice-projects/triangle-doodles/Triangles.html)
  * [Second version](https://tradeideasphilip.github.io/practice-projects/triangle-doodles/MoreColors.html)
  * [Third version](https://tradeideasphilip.github.io/practice-projects/triangle-doodles/3Colors.html)
* Sierpiński Triangle [Photo Album](https://tradeideasphilip.github.io/practice-projects/album/SierpińskiAlbum.html) — If you have three kids this would be a great way to make a photo album. ⭐
* [DOS Themed CSS](https://tradeideasphilip.github.io/practice-projects/dos/DOS.html) — I found this on the web somewhere.  I don't know what to do with this, but I gotta do something!
* N-Queens — This is a classic problem.
  * [First version](https://tradeideasphilip.github.io/practice-projects/n-queens/NQueens.html)
  * [Later version](https://tradeideasphilip.github.io/practice-projects/n-queens/NQueens4.html) ⭐
* [Snake](https://tradeideasphilip.github.io/practice-projects/snake/Snake.html) — Another classic.  I first learned this in BASIC on a TI 99/4.
* [3d text](https://tradeideasphilip.github.io/practice-projects/3d.html) — You need some imagination to see these.  I had much better luck with [ThreeJS](https://github.com/TradeIdeasPhilip/bounce-3d).
* [Binary Blocks](https://tradeideasphilip.github.io/practice-projects/BinaryBlocks.html) — Teach binary to kids.  Teach me drag and drop.
* [Bounce](https://tradeideasphilip.github.io/practice-projects/bounce.html) — A very simple physics simulation.
* [Circles](https://tradeideasphilip.github.io/practice-projects/Circles.html) ⭐
  * The idea came from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JN5f7_3YmQ).
  * Click on a circle on the top row to change it.
  * I love the old [Motif](https://www.google.com/search?q=motif+x+windows&sxsrf=ALiCzsaYpHgDul1IN0c_WdWfKlLZqUUlwA:1657767543325&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwioyaissff4AhVNDkQIHeBRAmAQ_AUoAnoECAIQBA&biw=1536&bih=761&dpr=2.5#imgrc=KWNDW57BcZCEaM) aesthetic, but I can make it look so much better now.
* [Conical Gradient](https://tradeideasphilip.github.io/practice-projects/Cone.html) — How to draw a high quality cone.  This used to be difficult, but conical gradient is standard CSS.
* [Dragon Scales](https://tradeideasphilip.github.io/practice-projects/DragonScales.html) — I love the way this looks.  Click the menu to configure it. ⭐
* [Ford Circles](https://tradeideasphilip.github.io/practice-projects/FordCircles.html) — Animated math fun. ⭐
* [Hexagons](https://tradeideasphilip.github.io/practice-projects/Hexagons.html) — Another homage to Motif.
* Sierpiński Triangle
  * [Solid](https://tradeideasphilip.github.io/practice-projects/PhilipińskiTriangle.html) — Set the middle control to 0 to get a traditional Sierpiński Triangle.  Raise that number to add more randomness.
  * [Outlines](https://tradeideasphilip.github.io/practice-projects/SierpińskiTriangle.html) — Another version.
